# NLP

I had an assignment to learn as much as I could about NLP in a week. I did this project one evening in order to get a better understanding of...
1. Python
2. NLTK
3. Flask

So that I could better demonstrate the capabilities of NLP to our leadership. This program is very simple, finding the most common words 
in the article, weighing the sentences, and then returning the top 4 weighted sentences.
